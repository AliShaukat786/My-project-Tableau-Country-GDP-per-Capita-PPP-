# My-project-Tableau-Country-GDP-per-Capita-PPP-


Aim of my work: To analyze the Data of different Nations and getting trends out of it i.e GDP-Per CApita-PP.

The Data "Wealth of Nations" gives all information about different countries GDP,Life-expetency and Smartphone users details.

Requirements: The client is colour blind and requested you to bear this in mind when building your dashboard. The client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. All of your visuals should be for the top 20 highest ranking countries.
